This is the backend part of a replica I made from the Rennes page on Tripadvisor.
This project only initiate a server that receive informations that a user has input on a form wich has been placed at the place where the login button is supposed to be on Tripadvisor.

Made using nodejs during the Reacteur Bootcamp.
